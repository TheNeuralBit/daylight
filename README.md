# Daylight
A D3 visualization of daylight time throughout the year based on lat/long. 
Uses Leaflet for lat/long selection, and D3 for plotting the sunrise/sunset times. 
Borrows heavily from the D3 for Mere Mortals tutorial [here](http://www.recursion.org/d3-for-mere-mortals/) for sunrise/sunset plotting.
